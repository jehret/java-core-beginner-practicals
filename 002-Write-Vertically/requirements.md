# Practical 002 - Write your name vertically

## Goal
By the end of this exercise, you will be able to declare and initialize a variable.

## Requirements
Please refer to the requirements on the platform you subscribed to.

## Template
If you don't know where to start:

    public class Vertical {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            letter='';
        }
    }

## Tip
To display your name vertically, consider printing a character per line.
For each line, extract a single letter from your name and store it in a variable.
Variables in Java have a type, what it the type for a character?
Then, print the content of this variable to display the letter on a new line.
