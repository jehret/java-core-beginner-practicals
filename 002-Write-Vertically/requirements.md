# Practical 002 - Write your name vertically

## Goal
By the end of this exercise, you will be able to declare and initialize a variable.

## Requirements
In this exercise, you'll use a variable to display your first name vertically on the screen, with each letter appearing on a new line. For example:

W
i
l
l
i
a
m

You'll use a variable to store each letter one at a time.
Then, you'll display the content of this variable line by line.

## Template
If you don't know where to start:

    public class Vertical {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            letter='';
        }
    }

## Tip
To display your name vertically, consider using a loop.
In each iteration, extract a single letter from your name and store it in a variable.
Then, print the content of this variable to display the letter on a new line.
