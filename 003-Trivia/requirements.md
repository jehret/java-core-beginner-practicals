# Practical 003 - Trivia: First String Variable

## Goal
By the end of this exercise, you will be able to identify, declare, and initialize your first String variable in Java.

## Requirements
Well, now it's your turn to play!
Below you'll find an incomplete code that contains only questions, a series of 5 questions to be precise.
You must use a String variable that you will name 'answer' to successively store the answer to each question. Display the answer using System.out.println.
The platform will not only evaluate whether your code is correct but will also give you your score, so good luck!

## Template
If you don't know where to start:

    public class Trivia {

        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println("What was Roland Garros' profession?");
            System.out.println("What were the names of the American missions that led the first man to the moon?");
            System.out.println("What does the chemical symbol N stand for?");
            System.out.println("Who wrote The Red and the Black?");
            System.out.println("Which country is found between Italy and Liechtenstein?");
        }
    }

## Tip
You can call the String variable `answer` for instance. 
Use this variable to store the answer to each question. 
After storing each answer, use `System.out.println(answer);` to display it on the console.
