# Practical 003 - Trivia: First String Variable

## Goal
By the end of this exercise, you will be able to identify, declare, and initialize your first String variable in Java.

## Requirements
Please refer to the requirements on the platform you subscribed to.

## Template
If you don't know where to start:

```java
public class Trivia {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("What was Roland Garros' profession?");
        System.out.println("What were the names of the American missions that led the first man to the moon?");
        System.out.println("What does the chemical symbol N stand for?");
        System.out.println("Who wrote The Red and the Black?");
        System.out.println("Which country is found between Italy and Liechtenstein?");
    }
}
```

## Tip
You can call the String variable `answer` for instance. 
Use this variable to store the answer to each question. 
After storing each answer, use `System.out.println(answer);` to display it on the console.
