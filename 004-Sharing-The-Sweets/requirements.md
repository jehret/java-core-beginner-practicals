# Practical 004 - Sharing the Sweets: Arithmetic Operators.

## Goal
By the end of this exercise, you will be able to perform division in Java, a tricky arithmetic operations in programming, involving concepts like whole and decimal division, and modulo operator.

## Requirements
Please refer to the requirements on the platform you subscribed to.

## Template
If you don't know where to start:

    public class SharingTheSweets {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(candiesForEach);
            System.out.println(candiesForTheTeacher);
            System.out.println(candiesForEachIfIHadAKnife);
        }
    }

## Tip
Use whole division to find out how many candies each student will get.
To find out if any candies are left over, use the remainder operation (the `%` sign in Java).
Finally, try dividing the numbers as if you could cut the candies into smaller pieces to share
