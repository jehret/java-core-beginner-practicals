## Goal
By the end of this exercise, you will be able to use Java to print out content in the console, including special characters.

## Requirements

## Template
If you don't know where to start:

```java
public class AsciiArt {
    public static void main(String... args){
        System.out.println("----------Oooo---");
        System.out.
    }
}

## Tip
Special characters like &#92; or &rdquo; for instance must be escaped (goes before) by a &#92;
